# Custom Card Games with the Cameo Cutting Machine

![](images/display.jpg)

Ever wanted to make your own custom card game but without the hassle of a craft knife, a rotary cutter, or a paper guillotine? How about making your own proxies to playtest your favorite TCG?

You can do it all with the press of a button and a cutting machine! And I can show you how!

If this is your first time here, check out the [tutorial](https://alan-cha.github.io/silhouette-card-maker-testing/tutorial/)! Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc) too!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to enable you to use a Silhouette cutting machine to create card games and proxies. Proxies are only intended to be used for casual play and playtesting.

You may not use this repo to disguise fake cards to decieve people or to play in sanctioned tournaments. You are only permitted to sell cards if you are the full privileged copyright holder.

You can find all the cutting templates for Silhouette Studio in [`cutting_templates/`](cutting_templates/).

## create_pdf.py
`create_pdf.py` is a CLI tool that layouts your card images into a printable PDF. Then, you can cut out the cards with the appropriate cutting template in [`cutting_templates/`](cutting_templates/).

### Basic Usage

Create a Python virtual environment.
```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the Python virtual environment.
**Terminal (macOS/Linux):**
```shell
. venv/bin/activate
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Download Python packages.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Put your front images in `game/front`.

Put your back image in `game/back`.

Run the script.
```shell
python create_pdf.py
```

Get your PDF at `game/output/game.pdf`.

### Plugins

Plugins streamline the process for acquiring card images for various games.

The MTG plugin is currently available, which can automatically acquire card images based on a decklist. Various decklist formats are supported, including MTGA, MTGO, Archidekt, Deckstats, Moxfield, and Scryfall. To learn more, see [here](plugins/mtg/README.md).

### Double-Sided Cards

To create double-sided cards, put front images in `game/front` and back images in `game/double_sided`. The filenames must match for each pair.

### Corner Artifacts

If your card images have rounded corners, they may be missing print bleed in the PDF. You may have seen white Xs appear in your PDF; these are artifacts from rounded corners. Because of the missing print bleed, when these cards are cut, they may have a sliver of white on the corners.

![Extend corners](images/extend_corners.jpg)

The `--extend_corners` option can ameliorate this issue. You may need to experiment with the value but I recommend starting with `10`

```shell
python create_pdf.py --extend_corners 10
```

### CLI Options

  --paper_size [letter|tabloid|a4|a3|archb]
                                  The desired paper size.  [default: letter]
  --only_fronts                   Only use the card fronts, exclude the card
                                  backs.
  --crop FLOAT RANGE              Crop a percentage of the outer portion of
                                  front and double-sided images, useful for
                                  existing print bleed.  [0<=x<=100]
  --extend_corners INTEGER RANGE  Reduce artifacts produced by rounded corners
                                  in card images.  [default: 0; x>=0]
  --ppi INTEGER RANGE             Pixels per inch (PPI) when creating PDF.
                                  [default: 300; x>=0]
  --quality INTEGER RANGE         File compression. A higher value corresponds
                                  to better quality and larger file size.
                                  [default: 75; 0<=x<=100]
  --load_offset                   Apply saved offsets. See `offset_pdf.py` for
                                  more information.
  --name TEXT                     Label each page of the PDF with a name.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

### Examples

Do not generate the back side. This option is useful if you want to save ink and produce single-sided cards.

```shell
python create_pdf.py --only_fronts
```

Create poker-sized cards with A4 sized paper.

```shell
python create_pdf.py --card_size poker --paper_size a4
```

Crop the borders of the front and double-sided images. This option is useful if your images already have print bleed.

```shell
python create_pdf.py --crop 6.5
```

Remove the [white corners](#white-corners) from the PDF and load the saved offset from [`offset_pdf.py`](#offset_pdfpy).

```shell
python create_pdf.py --extend_corners 10 --load_offset
```

Produce a 600 pixels per inch (PPI) file with minimal compression.

```shell
python create_pdf.py --ppi 600 --quality 100
```

## offset_pdf.py

It's pivotal to ensure that your the fronts and backs are aligned. However, it's not always possible to calibrate a printer.

`offset_pdf.py` is a CLI tool that adds an offset to every other page in a PDF, i.e. all the back pages. This offset can compensate for the natural offset from your printer.

### Basic Usage

First, you must determine the offset by using the [calibration sheets](calibration/).

`calibration.pdf` has a front page and a back page.

The front page is a simple grid of squares.

The back page is the same grid of squares, except each square has a slight offset. The following grid illustrates the applied offsets.

```
| (-2, -2) | (-1, -2) | ( 0, -2) | ( 1, -2) | ( 2, -2) |
--------------------------------------------------------
| (-2, -1) | (-1, -1) | ( 0, -1) | ( 1, -1) | ( 2, -1) |
--------------------------------------------------------
| (-2,  0) | (-1,  0) |  Center  | ( 1,  0) | ( 2,  0) |
--------------------------------------------------------
| (-2,  1) | (-1,  1) | ( 0,  1) | ( 1,  1) | ( 2,  1) |
--------------------------------------------------------
| (-2,  2) | (-1,  2) | ( 0,  2) | ( 1,  2) | ( 2,  2) |
```

To determine the required offset, print out `calibration.pdf` with the card stock you plan to use.

Shine a strong light on the front so you can see the shadows on the back. Determine the square such that the front square and the back square are aligned with each other. This square will provide your offset. Now, you can use `offset_pdf.py` to apply the appropriate offset to your PDF.

Create and start your virtual Python environment and install Python dependencies if you have not done so already. See [here](#basic-instructions) for more information.

Run the script.
```shell
python offset_pdf.py --x_offset -5 --y_offset 10
```

Get your offset PDF at `game/output/game_offset.pdf`.

### Save Offset

You can save your x and y offset with the `--save` option. After saving your offset, it'll be automatically applied every time you run `offset_pdf.py`. You can override the loaded offset using `--x_offset` and `--y_offset`.

```shell
python offset_pdf.py --x_offset -5 --y_offset 10 --save
```

Additionally, you can automatically apply a saved offset in [`create_pdf.py`](#create_pdfpy) by using the `--load_offset` option.

```shell
python create_pdf.py --load_offset
```

### CLI Options
